  <h1>Enveloppes API - Manage your budget !</h1>
  <p class="description">The envelope budgeting method is a simple, systematic way of saving money and paying bills. 
    The method helps you set aside what you need for bills while maintaining a personal budget. 
    The envelope budgeting system divides your income into different spending categoriesâ€”bills, groceries, gas, and so on. 
    Once you've decided how much you should spend on each category, you'll take that amount in cash and place it into an envelope. Then, only spend what's available in that envelope for that category's bills or purchases. The aim is to prevent you from overspending by limiting what is available to spend.</p>
